# cov-2-mutations-by-lineage
Quick analysis to associate SARS-Cov-2 spike mutations with pangolin lineages using GISAID data

Results available in [muts_by_lineage.csv](muts_by_lineage.csv). The first column gives mutations
found in >80% of sequences for the given lineage. The other two columns use a 50% and 10% threshold.

These results were generated by doing a pairwise alignment of each entry's Spike sequence to
the WIV04 reference sequence, identifing mutations, and grouping them by the pangolin lineage
annotations that GISAID provides in the metadata file.

To regenerate this analysis, you will need the Spike protein sequences from GISAID, as well as 
the GISAID metadata file. The analysis is in the [analysis.ipynb](analyis.ipynb) notebook.
